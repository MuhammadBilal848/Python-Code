# has "1" third value has "2" and so on so on.
# list contain multiple data types in it. In a list we can use string,integer or float data and so on so on.

#                                                       list vs python
# in C , C++ and Java
# In the aboe lang. arry is used and we can only store same data types in an arry(means all string elements,all integer elements etc)
# we dont use arry module much in python because it does not have flexibility in it instead we use numpy arrys(numpy is a data science library)
# nunmpy arrys - binding with c libraries
# list - store any data = flexible
# But in python we can store multiple data types in single list

# python arry module = fix data type
# python have arry moodule by which we can use arry(fix data type) which have same characteristics as other programming languages have.

# javascript arry = python list (both are flexible)
