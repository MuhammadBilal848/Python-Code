# * In 2005, **Travis Oliphant** created **NumPy**.
# * Numpy is **Python Package** designed for scientific computation.
# * **Numpy Arrys** are the main reason to use Numpy Library.

# Creating ndarrays
# The easiest way to create an array is to use the array function. This accepts any sequence-like object (including
# other arrays) and produces a new NumPy array con‐taining the passed data. For example, a list is a good 
# candidate for conversion.
print('                                making of 1-d array',end='\n\n')
data = [6, 7.5, 8, 0, 1]
arr = np.array(data) # this is 1-d array or vector
print(arr)


# Nested sequences, like a list of "equal-length lists", will be converted into a multidimensional array:
print('                                making of nd-array',end='\n\n')
data1 = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]
arr1 = np.array(data1) # this is 2-d array or matrix
print(arr1)

# An important thing to remember while making nd-array is that the list of lists must be of equal-length, if the list of lists 
# will not be having equal-length then we cannot call it nd-array and it will become a 1d-array in form of tuple.
arr = np.array([['Pakista','Turkey'],['Saudia','Indonesia','Italy']])
print(arr)
print(arr.ndim)


# Now the above array is 2d array and to confirm this we can use 'ndim' attribute.
# ndim represents the number of dimensions (axes) of the ndarray.
# we can also identify dimension by counting number of brackets on the closing and opening ends of an arry.
print('                                identifying dimensions of an array',end='\n\n')

print(a.ndim)
print(b.ndim)

print(d.ndim)


# Now how can we indentify the shape of an array to confrin this we can use 'shape' attribute.
# shape is a tuple of integers representing the size of the ndarray in each dimension.

# In addition to np.array, there are a number of other functions for creating new
# arrays. As examples, zeros and ones create arrays of 0s or 1s, respectively, with a

# # Numpy - Basic Indexing and Slicing

# In[99]:


# NumPy array indexing is a rich topic, as there are many ways you may want to select
# a subset of your data or individual elements. 
# One-dimensional arrays are simple on the surface they act similarly to Python lists.
arr = np.arange(11)
print(arr)
print(arr[6])
print(arr[4:8])
arr[5:8] = 0
print(arr)
# As you can see, if you assign a scalar value to a slice, as in arr[5:8] = 0, the value is
# propagated (or broadcasted henceforth) to the entire selection. An important first dis‐
# tinction from Python’s built-in lists is that array slices are views on the original array.
# This means that the data is not copied, and any modifications to the view will be
# reflected in the source array.
# To give an example of this, I first create a slice of arr.
arr_slice = arr[5:8]
print(arr_slice)
# Now, when I change values in arr_slice, the mutations are reflected in the original array arr.
arr_slice[1] = -9 # this change will push in my original array in which i have assigned zeros
print(arr)
# The “bare” slice [:] will assign to all values in an array.
arr_slice[:] = 64
print(arr)
# If you are new to NumPy, you might be surprised by this, especially if you have used
# other array programming languages that copy data more eagerly. As NumPy has been
# designed to be able to work with very large arrays, you could imagine performance
# and memory problems if NumPy insisted on always copying data.

# What are views of an array?
# As its name is saying, it is simply another way of viewing the data of the array.
# Technically, that means that the data of both objects is shared. You can create views by selecting a slice of
# the original array, or also by changing the dtype (or a combination of both). These different kinds of views 
# are described below.
# more on this,
# [https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/ViewsVsCopies.html#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20view%20of,of%20both%20objects%20is%20shared.]


# $$$ If you want a copy of a slice of an ndarray instead of a view, you
# will need to explicitly copy the array—for example, arr[5:8].copy()[by value copy].
b = arr[5:8].copy()
print(b)


# With higher dimensional arrays, you have many more options. In a two-dimensional
# array, the elements at each index are no longer scalars but rather one-dimensional arrays
arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(arr2d[2])
print(arr2d[2][1])
# Thus, individual elements can be accessed recursively. But that is a bit too much
# work, so you can pass a comma-separated list of indices to select individual elements.
# So these are equivalent,
print(arr2d[2,1])

# See Figure 4-1 for an illustration of indexing on a two-dimensional array. I find it
# helpful to think of axis 0 as the “rows” of the array and axis 1 as the “columns.” 
# 1) AXIS 0 IS THE DIRECTION ALONG THE ROWS , axis 0 is the axis that runs downward down the rows(which means that any change 
# in axis 0 will apply to column)
# 2) AXIS 1 IS THE DIRECTION ALONG THE COLUMN , axis 1 is the axis that runs horizontally across the columns(which means that
# any change in axis 1 will apply to rows)

# # Numpy - Boolean Indexing

# Let’s consider an example where we have some data in an array and an array of names

# some random normally distributed data:
names = np.array(['Bob', 'Joe', 'Will', 'Bob', 'Will', 'Joe', 'Joe']) 
# print(names)
data = np.random.randn(7,4)
print(data)
# Suppose each name corresponds to a row in the data array and we wanted to select
# all the rows with corresponding name 'Bob'. Like arithmetic operations, compari‐
# sons (such as ==) with arrays are also vectorized. Thus, comparing names with the
# string 'Bob' yields a boolean array.
print(names == 'Bob') # since arthimetic operations in numpy applies on each and every element of an array and in this array
# this will return boolan arrays.
print(data[names == 'Bob']) # in this step what we've done is we have pasted/overlaped our boolean array(as index value) which we
# have created above, due to which whichever index that has 'True' value will be replaced by the same index number in data array
# and rest of the index values wihch have 'False' will also be removed from data array.  
# so in boolean array only 0 and 3 has 'True' value so in data array only 0 and 3 
# index number will be left and others will be removed.
# passing boolean array as index is a method to paste/overlap data.

# The boolean array must be of the same length as the array axis it’s indexing. You can
# even mix and match boolean arrays with slices or integers

# $$$ Boolean selection will not fail if the boolean array is not the correct
# length, so I recommend care when using this feature.


# I select from the rows where names == 'Bob' and index the columns, too. [means that code before comma is for rows and code 
# after comma is for column] --or-- [rows,column]
print(data[names == 'Bob',1])
# print(data[(names == 'Bob'),2])
# print(data[(names == 'Bob'),1:])

print(names != 'Bob')
print(data[names != 'Bob'])

# -------------- OR --------------

cond = names == 'Bob'
print(data[~(cond)])
# The ~(tilde) operator can be useful when you want to invert a general condition:

# Selecting two of the three names to combine multiple boolean conditions, use
# boolean arithmetic operators like & (and) and | (or):
new = (names == 'Bob') | (names == 'Will')
print(new)
print(data[new])
# Selecting data from an array by boolean indexing always creates a copy of the data,
# even if the returned array is unchanged.
# $$$ The Python keywords and and or do not work with boolean arrays. Use & (and) and | (or) instead.

print(data[data>0]) # here data>0 will create a boolean array in which all the index filled with True which holds value greater
# than 0 and rest of them filled with False, and as we passed this bool array as index on our data var so this will bring all the
# values greater than 0

# Setting values with boolean arrays works in a common-sense way. To set all of the
# negative values in data to 0 we need only do
data[data < 0 ] = 0
print(data)

# Setting whole rows or columns using a one-dimensional boolean array is also easy:

# # Numpy - Transposing Arrays and Swapping Axes

# In[744]:


# Transposing is a special form of reshaping that similarly returns a view on the under‐
# lying data without copying anything. Arrays have the transpose method and also the
# special T attribute
arr = np.arange(24).reshape(6,4)
print(arr.T) # here T used as data discriptor for Transpose we can also use transpose() function
print(arr.transpose())

# we can find dot product of two sets using dot function
# 0-D 
a = 2

# 1-D

b = np.array([[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]])
# print(a)

# Here "permute" means "rearrange", so rearranging the order of axes.

# how can we contemplate which index number of transposed array holds which value of previous array? 

# Answer: The shape of arr is (2, 2, 4), for the value 7, you can get the value by arr[0, 1, 3] , after tranpose we just need to
# reverse the value index list and we got our new index number for that value. Here value for 7 arr[0,1,3][::-1] = arr[3,1,0]

# # Numpy - Universal Functions: Fast Element-Wise Array Functions

# In[93]:


# A universal function, or ufunc, is a function that performs element-wise operations
# on data in ndarrays. You can think of them as fast vectorized wrappers for simple
# functions that take one or more scalar values and produce one or more scalar results.

# Many ufuncs are simple element-wise transformations, like sqrt or exp:
arr = np.arange(10)
print(arr,end='\n\n')

# Functions which takes single array as argument are called 'unary ufuncs' [unary means single component or element]

print('             Square Root')
# for square root
print(np.sqrt(arr),end='\n\n') # square root of all numbers from 0 to 10

print('             Exponent')
# for exponent 
print(np.exp(arr),end='\n\n') # this will calculate exponential of all elements (e**0 , e**1 , e**2 , e**3 ,....)

# Functions which takes two array as argument are called 'binary ufuncs' [binary means double component or element]

# to find maximum of between two arrays, numpy has function called 'maximum'
x = np.random.randn(10)
y = np.random.randn(10)

# While not common, a ufunc can return multiple arrays. modf is one example, a vec‐
# torized version of the built-in Python divmod(a python function which takes two numbers
# and returns a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder.) it returns the fractional and integral
# parts of a floating-point array.

# will not affect my original array or will not save this array in place of my original array.
# print(arr) # here we can see there is no change in my original array

# if we wamt to make the change global or to want to keep the array value same as changed array value for this we can use
# another arugment of sqrt function which is 'out'(its basically a location/var where you want to to save changed array but it 
# must have shape same as the array we want to store)

# # Numpy - Expressing Conditional Logic as Array Operations

# In[52]:


# The numpy.where function is a vectorized version of the ternary expression x if condition else y. Suppose we had a
# boolean array and two arrays of values:
xarr = np.array([1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5])
yarr = np.array([2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5])
cond = np.array([True, False, True, True, False])
# Suppose we wanted to take a value from xarr whenever the corresponding value in cond is True, and otherwise take the value 
# from yarr. A list comprehension doing this might look like:
result = [(x if c else y) for x, y, c in zip(xarr, yarr, cond)]
print(result)
# This has multiple problems. First, it will not be very fast for large arrays (because all the work is being done in
# interpreted Python code). Second, it will not work with multidimensional arrays. With np.where you can write 
# this very concisely:
result = np.where(cond, xarr, yarr)
print(result)


# generally, np.where works like this,
#                 1       2        3
# np.where(condition,option-A,option-B)
# 1)The condition 
# 2)What to do with entities for which the condition is True.
# 3)What to do with entities for which the condition is False.



# The second and third arguments to np.where don’t need to be arrays; one or both of them can be scalars. A typical use of
# where in data analysis is to produce a new array of values based on another array. Suppose you had a matrix of randomly
# generated data and you wanted to replace all positive values with 2 and all negative values with –2. This is very easy 
# to do with np.where:
arr = np.random.randn(4, 4)
print(arr)
print(arr>0)
result1 = np.where(a>0,2,-2)
print(result1)
# You can combine scalars and arrays when using np.where. For example, I can replace all positive values in arr with
# the constant 2 like so:
result2 = np.where(arr > 0, 2, arr) # set only positive values to 2
print(result2)
# The arrays passed to np.where can be more than just equal-sized arrays or scalars.


# # Numpy - Mathematical and Statistical Methods

# In[99]:


# A set of mathematical functions that compute statistics about an entire array or about
# the data along an axis are accessible as methods of the array class. You can use aggre‐
# gations (often called reductions) like sum, mean, and std (standard deviation) either by
# calling the array instance method or using the top-level NumPy function.
# To explain what I mean by “aggregate,” I’ll give you a simple example.
# Imagine you have a set of 5 numbers. If sum up those 5 numbers, the result will be a single number.
# Summation effectively aggregates your data. It collapses a large number of values into a single value.


# Here I generate some normally distributed random data and compute some aggregate
# statistics:
arr = np.random.randn(5, 4)
print(arr)

# to find mean of an entire array we can use mean function,
print(arr.mean())

print(np.mean(arr))
 
# to find sum of an entire array we can use sum function,
print(arr.sum())
# OOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
print(np.sum(arr))

# Functions like mean and sum take an optional axis argument that computes the statis‐
# tic over the given axis, resulting in an array with one fewer dimension:
# axis = 0 (will apply across column)
# axis = 1 (will apply across rows)
print(arr.mean(axis=1))
print(arr.sum(axis=0))

# Here, arr.mean(1) means “compute mean across the columns” where arr.sum(0)
# means “compute sum down the rows.”
# Other methods like cumsum and cumprod do not aggregate, instead producing an array
# of the intermediate results:
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
print(arr.cumsum()) # thats how comulative sum works [0,0+1,0+1+2,0+1+2+3,0+1+2+3+4,....so onnn]
print(arr.cumprod()) # thats how comulative sum works [0,0*1,0*1*2,0*1*2*3,0*1*2*3*4,....so onnn]


# In multidimensional arrays, accumulation functions like cumsum return an array of
# the same size, but with the partial aggregates computed along the indicated axis
# according to each lower dimensional slice:
arr = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
print(arr)
print(arr.cumsum(axis=0))
print(arr.cumprod(axis=1))

print(bools.all()) # all returns True if all elements in an array are True

# These methods also work with non-boolean arrays, where non-zero elements evaluate to True.


# # Numpy - Sorting

# In[278]:


# Like Python’s built-in list type, NumPy arrays can be sorted in-place with the sort method:
arr = np.random.randn(6)
print(arr)
arr.sort()
print(arr)

# You can sort each one-dimensional section of values in a multidimensional array inplace along 
# an axis by passing the axis number to sort:
arr1 = np.random.randn(5, 3)
print(arr1)
arr1.sort(1)
print(arr1)
# The top-level method np.sort returns a sorted copy of an array instead of modifying the array in-place.


# # Numpy - Unique and Other Set Logic

# In[109]:


# NumPy has some basic set operations for one-dimensional ndarrays. A commonly
# used one is np.unique, which returns the sorted unique values in an array:
# unique function has four parameters, 
# arr(The input array. Will be flattened if not 1-D array)
# return_index(If True, returns the indices of elements in the input array)
# return_inverse(If True, returns the indices of unique array, which can be used to reconstruct the input array)
# return_counts(If True, returns the number of times the element in unique array appears in the original array)

names = ['Bilal','Abuzar','Usama','Nofil','Zaigham','Hasan','Usama','Abuzar','Zaigham']
names = np.unique(names)
print(names)

ints = np.array([3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4])
ints1 = np.unique(ints)
print(ints1)
ints2 = np.unique(ints,return_index=True,return_counts=True)
print(ints2)
# in contrast np.unique with the pure Python alternative: sorted(set(names))


# Another function, numpy.in1d() test whether each element of a 1-D array
# is also present in a second array and return a boolean array the same length as arr1 that is True where 
# an element of arr1 is in arr2 and False otherwise.
# Syntax : numpy.in1d(arr1, arr2, assume_unique = False, invert = False)
# Parameters :
# arr1 : [array_like] Input array.
# arr2 : [array_like] The values against which to test each value of arr1.
# assume_unique : [bool, optional] If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which can speed up the calculation. Default is False.
# invert : [bool, optional] If True, the values in the returned array are inverted. Default is False.


arr1 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5,1]) 
arr2 = [0, 2, 5,5] 
result = np.in1d(arr1, arr2) 
result1 = np.in1d(arr1, arr2,invert = True)
result2 = np.in1d(arr1, arr2,invert = True,assume_unique=True)
print(result)
print(result1)
print(result2)

# Another function, Intersect1d Compute the sorted, common elements in x and.
arr1 = np.array([1, 1, 2, 3, 4]) 
arr2 = np.array([2, 1, 4, 6])

# # Numpy - File Input and Output with Arrays

# In[348]:


# NumPy is able to save and load data to and from disk either in text or binary format.
# np.save and np.load are the two workhorse functions for efficiently saving and load‐
# ing array data on disk. Arrays are saved by default in an uncompressed raw binary
# format with file extension .npy:
# np.save('filename.npy',array) if we dont pass file ext(npy) here, numpy will manage itself. 
# np.load('filename.npy')
# np.savez('filename.npz',array1,array2,..)

x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])

# now im going to save multiple arrays, for which i use savez function
# You save multiple arrays in an uncompressed archive using np.savez and passing the arrays as keyword arguments:
np.savez('test2.npz',a=x,b=y) # a = key, x = value | b = key , y = value dict = ['a':x , 'b':y ]
# now im going to load this file, When loading an .npz file, you get back a dict-like object that loads the individual

# # Numpy - Linear Algebra

# In[92]:


# Linear algebra, like matrix multiplication, decompositions, determinants, and other
# square matrix math, is an important part of any array library. Unlike some languages
# like MATLAB, multiplying two two-dimensional arrays with * is an element-wise
# product instead of a matrix dot product. Thus, there is a function dot, both an array
# method and a function in the numpy namespace, for matrix multiplication:

a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print(a*b) # * will mutiply two matrices element by element 

# To find the dot product of two arrays.
a = 2
b = 3
print(np.dot(a,b))

# 1-D
a = np.array([1,2,3,4])
b = np.array([5,6,7,8])
print(np.dot(a,b)) # a.dot(b) is equivalent to np.dot(a, b):


# 2-D
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
b = np.array([[7,8],[9,10],[11,12]])
print(a)
print(b)
# here multiplication works as same as we did, (PS: column1== row2)
# [1 2 3]   [ 7  8]
# [4 5 6] x [ 9 10]
#           [11 12]
print(a.dot(b))

# A matrix product between a two-dimensional array and a suitably sized onedimensional array results in a one-dimensional array:
x = np.array([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]])
print(np.dot(x, np.ones(3)))

# The @ symbol (as of Python 3.5) also works as an infix operator that performs matrix multiplication:
print(x @ np.ones(3))

# numpy.linalg has a standard set of matrix decompositions and things like inverse
# and determinant. These are implemented under the hood via the same industrystandard linear algebra libraries used in
# other languages like MATLAB and R, such as BLAS, LAPACK, or possibly (depending on your NumPy build) the proprietary Intel
# MKL (Math Kernel Library):
# linalg = linear algebra
from numpy.linalg import *
arr = np.arange(4).reshape(2,2)
print(arr)
arr1 = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)
print(arr1)
# # to find determinant of a matrix , we can use det function of linalg module
# print(det(arr))
print(det(arr1))
# print(inv(arr1)) # this will cause error because the determinant of arr1 is 0 , inv(A)= adj(A)/|A|
# now we find inv of that array whose det is not zero
arr = np.random.randn(5,5)

arr1 = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5)

''' A good source to know about seed function is, [https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/numpy-random-seed/]'''

# ### Appendix A

# ## Numpy - Reshaping Arrays
# * Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data. 
# * Gives a new shape to an array as well as dimensions.
# * Syntax - numpy.reshape(a, newshape, order='C') 

# In[83]:


# in the array below i have 25 elements and to reshape it i just need to find the factors of 25.
# 25=5x5 (this is the only factor of 25)
arr = np.arange(25)
print(arr)
print(arr.reshape(5,5))

# another method to reshape an array can be,
arr = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5) # this is similar to the above one and handy as well
print(arr)
# last parameter of reshape is order. which defines how an array will going to be look.
# C - order means the array will be a row major array. (By default)
# F - order means the array will be a column major array.
# for visual representation (visit Python for Aata Analysis by Wes McKinney book pg. no 452) for figure A-3


arr = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5,order='C') # row major
print(arr)
arr = np.arange(25).reshape(5,5,order='F') # column major
print(arr)

# some more ex. of reshaping
arr = np.arange(24).reshape(4,6) # factors of 24 are, 24(4,6) , 24(2,2,6) , 24(2,2,3,2)

arr = np.arange(24).reshape(2,2,3,2)
print(arr)

# you'll get an error if you cant fill up the matrix completely.

# print(np.arange(24).reshape(2,2,3)) # here matrix is not comletely filled
# if you want to prevent the error you can put -1 in that position , after which numpy will responsible for mangening this.
# a thing to remember is that we can replace -1 only once like this reshape(n,n,..,-1) if we do this reshape(n,n,..,-1,-1)
# this will cause error.

print(np.arange(24).reshape(2,2,-1)) # here -1 will replace to 6 because thats the only number which will complete the 
# number (2x2x6)
print(np.arange(24).reshape(2,2,3,-1)) # here -1 will replace to 3 because thats the only number which will complete the 
# number (2x2x3x3)


# ## Numpy - Concatenating and Splitting Arrays
# * Concatenate takes a sequence (tuple, list, etc.) of arrays and joins them together in order along the input axis.
# * In order to concatenate two or more arrays the number of dimensions must be same.

# In[196]:


arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
arr2 = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
# we can use square braces ans circular braces both to keep arrays as first parameter.
print(np.concatenate([arr1,arr2]))  
print(np.concatenate((arr1,arr2)))
# we can change the axis of concatenation as well, by default it is axis = 0.
print(np.concatenate([arr1,arr2],axis=1))  
print(np.concatenate((arr1,arr2),axis=1))

while concatenating array be carefull about the dimension and shape of an array.
a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
b = np.array([[5,6]])
a = (2,2)
b = (1,2)
axis(0,1)
print(np.concatenate((a,b))) # here axis is 0 which means the array will concatenate along axis 0(which is concatenating 
axis, (2,1) = 0 axis here) and we always need to check the values of axis other than concatenating axis(0)
and in order to concatenate the values should be same ( (2,2) = axis 1 and values are some ). thats why catenation is 
possible here.
print(np.concatenate((a,b),axis = 1)) # this will cause error because the values of axis other than concatenating axis(1)(
(2,2) = 1 axis here) are not same ( (2,1) = 0 axis here, clearly 2 and 1 are not same). thats why catenation is not 
possible here.
print(np.concatenate((a,b.T),axis = 1)) # here i transposed array b due to which the axis other than concatenating axis has
become equal. 
a = (2,2)
b = (2,1)
axis(0,1)

# There are some convenience functions, like vstack and hstack, for common kinds of concatenation. The preceding operations
# could have been expressed as:
print(np.vstack((arr1, arr2))) # vstack means vertical stack, in which axis is 0
print(np.hstack((arr1, arr2))) # hstack means vertical stack, in which axis is 1

# another function column_stack which take a sequence of 1-D arrays and stack them as columns to make a single 2-D array.
a = np.array((1,2,3))
b = np.array((2,3,4))
print(np.column_stack((a,b)))



# Split, on the other hand, slices apart an array into multiple arrays along an axis:
# arr = np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
# print(np.split(arr,3)) # here my arr has 9 elements and amd i have splitted my array into 3 parts.
# print(np.split(arr,(2,4,6))) # this will split at 2,4 and 6 index number.

arr = np.random.randint(1,50,25).reshape(5,5)
print(arr)
print(np.split(arr,(2,3),axis = 1)) # axis 1 represents columns
print(np.split(arr,(2,3),axis = 0)) # axis 0 represents rows

# There are some convenience functions, like vsplit and hsplit, for common kinds of splitting. The preceding operations
# could have been expressed as:
print(np.hsplit(arr,(2,3))) # hsplit means horizontal split
print(np.vsplit(arr,(2,3))) # vsplit means vertical split

# 1) AXIS 0 IS THE DIRECTION ALONG THE ROWS , axis 0 is the axis that runs downward down the rows(which means that any change 
# in axis 0 will apply to column)
# 2) AXIS 1 IS THE DIRECTION ALONG THE COLUMN , axis 1 is the axis that runs horizontally across the columns(which means that
# any change in axis 1 will apply to rows) 


# See Table A-1 for a full listing of concatenating and splitting functions. (visit Python for Aata Analysis by WesMcKinney 
# book pg. no 456) for Table A-1.


# ## Numpy - Stacking helpers: r_ and c_

# In[201]:


# There are two special objects in the NumPy namespace, r_ and c_, that make stacking
# arrays more concise:

arr1 = arr.reshape((3, 2))
arr2 = np.random.randn(3, 2)
print(np.r_[arr1, arr2])
print(np.c_[arr1,arr2])


# ## Numpy - Repeating Elements: tile and repeat
# * Tile constructs an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.
# * Syntax - numpy.tile(A, reps)
# * Repeat replicates each element in an array some number of times, producing a larger array.
# * Syntax - numpy.repeat(a, repeats, axis=None)

# In[208]:


# Two useful tools for repeating or replicating arrays to produce larger arrays are the repeat and tile functions. 

# numpy.repeat repeats all the elements of an array according to specified value.
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
print(np.repeat(arr,3)) # here each element will repeat 3 times

# numpy.tile repeats the tile of elements of an array according to specified value.
arr = np.array([1,2,3])
print(np.tile(arr,2)) # here array will repeat 2 tiles.


# ## Numpy - Broadcasting
# * A term **Broadcasting** is used when an arthimetic operation is performed between two different sized array. 
# * **Rule # 1**:If two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimension is padded with ones on its leading side(left side)
# * **Rule # 2**: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape. 
# * **Rule # 3**: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and niether equal to 1, an error is raised.
